Convoy Ingester
=========

Convoy Ingester is a serverless function that acts as a middleware between API providers and Convoy. This enables consumers benefit from Convoy without providers taking advantage of Convoy yet. 

The plan is to make this first class support in Convoy, this repo is a prototype for that future.
